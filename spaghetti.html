    <h1>The Importance of Italian Cuisine</h1>
    <p>
      Italian cuisine (Italian: Cucina italiana) is a Mediterranean cuisine
      consisting of the ingredients, recipes and cooking techniques developed
      across the Italian Peninsula since antiquity, and later spread around the
      world together with waves of Italian diaspora. Significant changes
      occurred with the colonization of the Americas and the introduction of
      potatoes, tomatoes, capsicums, maize and sugar beet â€” the latter
      introduced in quantity in the 18th century. It is one of the best-known
      and the most appreciated gastronomies worldwide

    <h2>Spaghetti</h2>
    <p>
      Spaghetti is a long, thin, solid, cylindrical pasta. It is a staple food
      of traditional Italian cuisine. Like other
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasta" target="_blank">pasta</a>,
      spaghetti is made of milled wheat and water and sometimes enriched with
      vitamins and minerals. Italian spaghetti is typically made from durum
      wheat semolina. Usually the pasta is white because refined flour is used,
      but whole wheat flour may be added. Spaghettoni is a thicker form of
      spaghetti, while capellini is a very thin spaghetti.
